# Node Notes

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment which uses the V8 JavaScript engine (which powers Google Chrome) to run JavaScript outside the browser.

A Node app runs as a single process and doesn't create a new thread for every request.

When Node performs an I/O operation (like accessing a database or the filesystem) it doesn't block the thread waiting but instead resumes the operation when the response comes back.

### Differences between Node.js and client-side JavaScript

With Node, you don't have access to objects provided by the browser, such as `document` or `window`. Conversely, in the browser you don't have access to Node's modules and the APIs they make available.

With Node you control the environment your code runs in and can use the latest ECMAScript features. You don't have to wait for browsers to add support.

Currently Node uses the CommonJS module system while browsers are starting to use ES Modules. So most Node code will use `require()` while browsers use `import`.

### The V8 JavaScript Engine

V8 is the JavaScript engine that powers Chrome. V8 provides the runtime environment that the JavaScript executes in. The DOM and the other web APIs are provided by the browser.

Node benefits for the race for performance between browser providers. As V8 improves, Node becomes faster.

Although JavaScript is usually considered an interpreted language, modern JavaScript engine compile it.

Since JavaScript now has to run long-lasting and heavier browser-based applications like content streaming services and interactive maps, it makes sense to spend more time getting the JavaScript ready and then have it run as performant compiled code.
